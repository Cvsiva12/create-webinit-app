After running the command and providing a project name (if prompted):

1. The latest version of the [WebInit template](https://github.com/dev-onyx/webinit) is cloned into a new directory named after your project.
2. The template's original Git history and README.md are removed.
3. `package.json` is updated with your project's name, a default version (`0.1.0`), and a generated description. Template-specific metadata is removed.
4. A new, simple `README.md` is created for your project.
5. The placeholder title and welcome message in `src/pages/index.js` are updated with your project name.
6. Node.js dependencies are installed using `npm install`.
7. A new Git repository is initialized, and all files are committed.
8. The Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) is started, and your default browser is opened to `http://localhost:3000`.

You're then ready to start building your application!
