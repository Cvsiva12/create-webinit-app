## Installation

To get started, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

Once you have Node.js, you can install the CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g create-webinit-app
```

## Usage

After installation, you can create a new Next.js project by running:

```bash
create-webinit-app my-next-app
```

Replace `my-next-app` with your desired project name. This command will scaffold a new project using the WebInit template.

### Running Your Project

Navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

Once you scaffold a new project, you will see the following structure:

```
my-next-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
